SHELLCODING
=======
A collection of code for fun and exploration.
-----------

### Spawning a Shell
1. Write shellcode first in high-level.
2. Compile high-level code and disassemble it.
3. Analyse Assembly code.
4. Clean up Assembly, smaller and injectable.
5. Extract opcodes to use as final shellcode
